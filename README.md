# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to build a dynamic webpage which would allow users to filter UFO sightings data based on multiple criteria such as the date, city, state, country and UFO shape. 

## Results
The dynamic webpage will allow users to enter their desired criteria under the "Filter Search" section. The image below shows what the user sees when they first load the webpage.

The user would have to enter text that matches the existing placeholder to filter the data in the table. For example, the image below shows the filtered table if a user entered "fl" to filter based on the state of Florida.

The user can also enter multiple criteria to filter the data in the table. For example, the image below shows the filtered table if a user entered "fl" as the state and "sphere" as the shape.

In order to clear the filters, the user would have to clear the input so that it returns to the unfiltered table. 

## Summary 
The UFO Sightings webpage is able to successfully filter the table based on user input. One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that entered critera has to be manually cleared to remove the filter, which could be frustrating if a user entered more than one search criteria. A recommendation to help enhance the webpage would be to add a "Clear Search" button so that it can clear all inputs. Another recommendation would be to allow more flexible inputs like data that contains the value entered instead of an exact match to enhance the user experience.
